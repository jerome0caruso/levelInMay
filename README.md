This was a difficult challenge presented by:Bogdan Stashchuk in his JavaScript Bible course.  Trying to assign values to objects that did not have Id's and verify that there were no duplicates. Two files are included, my first and second attempt. 
script1 -This challenge shows: default function parameters and using them to run another function, template literals with higher order functions, filter, hasOwnProperty,includes, find, map, using sort method to sort key/value's from the object, using a do while loop to verify that the new value isn't a duplicate from the original object nor a new value that might have been created via Math.random and making a copy using a spread operator so as to not change or alter the original Object. script2- was not perfect but accomplished most/many tasks and learned to use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) to create a duplicate of an Object. ...Ohh and uploaded with a commad line (Cmder) to clone and push files here!
